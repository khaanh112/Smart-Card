## Dev Notes

### Implementation Details
- Using react-icons for platform icons (FaLinkedin, FaFacebook, etc.)
- Platform-specific URL validation in validationSchemas.js
- Same drag & drop pattern as Work Experience
- Email platform uses email validation instead of URL
- Website and Other platforms accept any valid URL
- Icons color-coded per platform (LinkedIn blue, Facebook blue, etc.)

### Technical Decisions
- Reused drag & drop pattern from Story 2.2
- Platform enum: LINKEDIN, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, TWITTER, GITHUB, WEBSITE, EMAIL, OTHER
- URL truncation with ellipsis for long links
- Platform icons enhance visual recognition

## Testing

2. Click "Add Social Link"
3. Select platform from dropdown
4. Enter URL - test validation
5. Test LinkedIn URL must contain linkedin.com
6. Save and verify entry appears
7. Drag to reorder links
8. Edit existing link
9. Delete link with confirmation
10. Try adding 11th link - should show limit
11. Click Back - returns to Step 2
12. Click Next - proceeds to Step 4
